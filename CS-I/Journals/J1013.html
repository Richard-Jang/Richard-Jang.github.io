    <h4>1: Why is one of the symbols used for <i>exclusive disjunction</i> &#8802 ?</h4>
    <p>The symbol for equivalence is &#8801, and this means that the output is true iff both inputs have the same value. Exclusive Disjunctions means that the output is true if either the inputs are true but are not true, the opposite of equivalence, therefore resulting in the slash going through &#8801 (&#8802).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>2: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the numberes of inputs, and why is the formula <b>2<sup>n</sup></b>?</h4>
    <p>The number of rows in a truth table is related only to the numbers of inputs because if each variable has two outcomes, true or false. Each row represent a possible outcome, so with <i>n</i> amount of inputs, there would be <b>2<sup>n</sup></b> amount of possibilities, resulting in <b>2<sup>n</sup></b> rows.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>I learned how boolean algebra works and how computers see math.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>Understanding the materials and applying my knowledge was a challenge.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>I think some more in-depth explanation would be helpful.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>I am starting to see different math differently and in a more advanced way.</p>
