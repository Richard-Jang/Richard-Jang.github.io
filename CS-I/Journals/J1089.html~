    <h4>1.1: Why do you think the Hello World program is typically the first program taught to students?</h4>
    <p>The Hello World program is a very simple input output program. It allows students to get used to the programming language, as well as learn a basic "print" command.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>1.2: How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it is written in?</h4>
    <p>Different languages have different ways to output data. The Hello World program can be written differently depending on how the language outputs data.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>The Hello World program has its history in helping coders learn to program, and it still continues to do this task today.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>Programming in Assembly Language is harder than programming in other languages I know, especially when doing it for the first time.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>For the mission, 12 Hello World programs seems a little excessive.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>I've learned that different programs have different ways of outputting data.</p>
