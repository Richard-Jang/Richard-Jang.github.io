    <h4>1.1: Compare this behavior to that of the <b>while</b> loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h4>
    <p>The "while" loop tests the condition before the "statement"; the "repeat-while" loop tests the condition after the statement.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>1.2: What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?</h4>
    <p>The minimum number of times that this loop will execute is one because the condition statement is run at the end of the loop</p>
    <br>

    <h4>1.3: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?</h4>
    <p>The <i>Jump</i> instruction loops the program back to the statement</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.1: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a <i>while</i> loop using a <i>repeat-while</i> loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h4>
    <p>Yes. This can be done by either changing the conditional variable's value inside or outside the loop.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.2: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a <i>repeat-while</i> loop using a <i>while</i> loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h4>
    <p>Yes. This can be done with the same process as above, which is changing the conditional value inside or outside of the value.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>I learned about the repeat-while loop and its functionality.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>I didn't have any challenges.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>This experience is good as is.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>The program can skip around in its instructions using loops.</p>
