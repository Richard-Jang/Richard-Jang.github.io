    <h1>Shell</h1>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">I received assistance from: no one</p>
    <p class="Question">I assisted: Mina and Ethan</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/ Server Model.</p>
    <p class="Answers">Messaging and Internet (like google)</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">2: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</p>
    <p class="Answers">I think that it is important because it allows different people to talk about the same subject and still be able to clearly locate both without getting them mixed up.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">3: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The home directory has a special symbol because it is easier to locate when you are in the home directory and where it is.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">4: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The prompt changed because we wanted to go into a certain directory, and this is useful for getting around directories.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">5.1: What happenes each time you press the (up arrow)?</p>
    <p class="Answers">Pressing the up arrow goes to the previous typed command.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">5.2: What happens each time you press the (down arrow)?</p>
    <p class="Answers">Pressing the down arrow allows you to scroll through the command list that you have typed.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">6: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</p>
    <p class="Answers">Text wasn't displayed because we only told the terminal to store the text.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">7.1: How does the "ls" command differ from the "tree" command?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The "ls" command only shows one path to the current directory. The tree command shows every directory and file under the home directory.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The "ls" command should be used when the user only wants to see the path to the current directory. When looking for a certain directory and its location, use the "tree" command.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The argument to sleep specifies the amount of time that you want the program to sleep in seconds.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</p>
    <p class="Answers">I can prove my hypothesis by running the sleep command with different value arguments and timing each of them.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">9.1: How is this behavior from what you expected?</p>
    <p class="Answers">I didn't expect to be able to run multiple sleep commands at the same time.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</p>
    <p class="Answers">Running a job in the background means that while the program is running, other programs can be executed at the same time.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">9.3: What do you think the number displayed in the brackets specifies?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The number in the brackets shows the order in which the jobs are run, kind of like an array for jobs.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">10.1: What do you observe as you execute the "jobs" command?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The list of jobs currently running is displayed.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">10.2: How do you explain your observations?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The "jobs" command shows an array of sorts displaying the jobs that are currently running and giving them what can be related to an ID.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</p>
    <p class="Answers">I learned the capabilities of the shell and that it has a great number of uses.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">What challenges did I encounter?</p>
    <p class="Answers">The idea of jobs was a bit challenging, but I now understand it.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">How could this experience be improved?</p>
    <p class="Answers">I think explaining more of what a shell is instead of what it can do will be much more useful.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="Question">Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</p>
    <p class="Answers">What I've learned today lets me think of the shell in a completely different way. I now think of it as a connected web of files and directories.</p>
