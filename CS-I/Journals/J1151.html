    <h4>1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h4>
    <p>Branching allows for computer programs to execute different tasks depending on a conditional.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>1.2: Why do you think the term <i>consequent</i> is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the <i>Boolean test</i> evaluates to true?</h4>
    <p>When boolean evaluates to true, consequent is executed because that is the main program, and the else is an alternative program that runs when boolean evaluates to false.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.1: Why is the first <i>Jump</i> instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h4>
    <p>The first jump is a conditional beause it compares the value and executes instructions based on the result. The operation of the jump command will determine whether the jump will be executed or not.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.2: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?</h4>
    <p>The Jump instruction after the consequent acts as a nested if statement, it moves to the "afterAlternative" if run.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Why is there no need for a corresponding <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>alternative</i>?</h4>
    <p>The "afterAlternative" is already under "alternative" so there is no need to jump.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>The big idea is that most big code projects should be planned out with flow charts.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>I found it difficult to decipher the Assembly Language.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>The Wiki is good enough as is.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>I now see machines differently.</p>
