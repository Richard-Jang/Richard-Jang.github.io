    <h4>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the <b>C</b>arry column?</h4>
    <p>The output of the <b>C</b>arry column is a standard output for an AND gate.</p>
    </br>

    <h4>1.2: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the <b>S</b>um column?</h4>
    <p>The output column of the <b>S</b>um column is the standard output for an XOR gate.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder.</h4>
    <p>For the carry-in row, the digits are reversed. For the two inputs (in this case a and b), the rows repeat (first half and bottom half are the same). For the carry-out column, the top half is an AND gate and the bottom half is an OR gate. For the sum output, the bottom half of the rows are inverses of the top half (the top half is XOR and the bottom half is EQUIVALENCE).</p>
    <br>

    <h4>2.2: Why is this true?</h4>
    <p>For the carry-in, the first half represents when there aren't any carries, and the second half represents when there is carry. The other inputs are the same because that is standard order for the truth table. The carry-out column is different because the carry-in column adds one, making the output carry more. The sum is different because the carry will inverse the sum output.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h4>
    <p>The least significant bit position uses a half-adder because there are no carries in that position.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be avaliable instantaneously? If not, why not?</h4>
    <p>For the half adder, the sum will be instantaneously because it won't have to consider the carry. For full-adders, the correct output will not be instantaneous because they have to take into account the carry from previous operations.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that <b>C<sub>15</sub></b> is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h4>
    <p>We can infer that the number will be greater than 65535. This number is called the 16-bit integer limit.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>I learned how electronics do addition with binary numbers.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>A challenge was understanding why the bits were different after factoring in the carry.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>This experience is very well built and understandable.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>This changed the way I interpret computers using electricity and computer chips to do math.</p>
