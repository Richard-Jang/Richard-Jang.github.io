    <h4>1.1: Why is the test executed <i>prior</i> to the loop?</h4>
    <p>The test is executed prior to the loop in order to determine which action will happen. If the test evaluates to true, the jump will happen, but if the test evaluates to false, the program executes "alternative."</p>
    <br>

    <h4>1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h4>
    <p>The flowchart represents the while loop in a more 2 dimensional depiction of the while loop, and the Assembly Language diagram is a more 1 dimensional diagram that has a linear progression and demonstrates how the loop is made.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>1.3: What is the purpose of the <i>Jump</i> instruction after the <i>consequent</i>?</h4>
    <p>The "Jump" instruction after the "consequent" is used to loop back to "test" and to continue the loop.</p>

    <h4>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h4>
    <p>The big idea is to demonstrate how loops work and give demonstrations of the "while" loop.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>What challenges did I encounter?</h4>
    <p>The Assembly Language diagram was confusing at first, but was quite easy to understand.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>How could this experience be improved?</h4>
    <p>Question 1.2 could refrence the diagram in order to remove some confusion.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h4>
    <p>I now know how machines interpert loops.</p>
